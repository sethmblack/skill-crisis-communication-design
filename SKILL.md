# Crisis Communication Design

Design compassionate, human crisis communications - especially layoffs - that maintain dignity, provide meaningful support, and preserve organizational trust. Speak from the heart, not from corporate templates.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Design communications that deceive or mislead affected people
- Create false promises of support that will not be delivered
- Help organizations avoid responsibility or accountability
- Design communications that blame affected parties for the crisis
- Assist with communications that violate employment law or ethical standards

**If asked to help with deceptive communications:** Refuse explicitly. Crisis communications must be honest, even when honesty is painful.

---

## When to Use

- Announcing layoffs or workforce reductions
- Communicating significant organizational changes
- Delivering difficult news to employees, customers, or stakeholders
- When standard corporate communications feel inadequate or inhumane
- When the stakes are high and trust is on the line
- Reviewing existing crisis communications for improvement

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| crisis_context | Yes | What is the situation requiring communication? |
| affected_population | Yes | Who will receive this communication? |
| support_being_offered | No | What concrete help can be provided? |
| speaker_voice | No | Who is delivering this message? Their relationship to audience? |
| company_values | No | What does the organization stand for? |
| constraints | No | Legal, timing, or regulatory limitations |

## The Chesky Philosophy

When Airbnb laid off 1,900 employees (25% of workforce) in May 2020, Brian Chesky's 3,374-word letter became a model for humane crisis communication.

**What Chesky observed about typical layoff communications:**
"I basically looked at a bunch of people who'd done layoff letters, and I noticed something about the way companies lay people off. It's pretty inhumane. It seems like a human being didn't write it. It feels like an AI prompt or something. AI is more compassionate than most of these layoff letters, and I think what ends up happening is that the CEOs get very risk averse. They're not vulnerable, they're afraid to say the wrong thing. They don't actually speak from the heart."

**Key Principles:**

1. **Speak from the heart** - Not corporate-speak
2. **Be vulnerable** - Acknowledge your own difficulty
3. **Cut deep enough** - Avoid the cruelty of multiple rounds
4. **Provide generous support** - Go beyond minimum requirements
5. **Actively help people land** - Don't just provide severance; help them find new jobs
6. **Take responsibility** - This is a leadership decision, own it

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Acknowledge the Reality

Before writing, confront:

**The Situation:**
- What is actually happening?
- Why is this necessary?
- Who is affected and how?

**Your Role:**
- What is your responsibility in this situation?
- What decisions led here?
- What could you have done differently?

**The Human Cost:**
- How will this affect real people's lives?
- What fears and concerns will they have?
- What do they need to hear?

### Step 2: Design the Support Structure

Before communicating, ensure substance backs the words:

**Immediate Support:**
- Severance (how much? what formula?)
- Healthcare continuation (duration, coverage)
- Mental health resources
- Equity treatment (vesting acceleration?)

**Transition Support:**
- Job placement assistance
- Alumni directory or network
- Recruiter connections
- Reference policy

**Respect and Dignity:**
- How will people learn their status?
- How much time will they have?
- Can they say goodbye to colleagues?
- What about personal items, files, projects?

**Chesky's Support Model:**
- 14+ weeks of severance
- 12 months of health insurance
- 4 months of mental health support
- Alumni directory (opt-in, public)
- CEO personally called other companies to hire affected employees

### Step 3: Structure the Communication

**Opening: Acknowledge the Pain**
- State clearly what is happening
- Do not bury the news or soften it deceptively
- Acknowledge this is painful

**Context: Explain Why**
- What circumstances led to this decision?
- What alternatives were considered?
- Why is this the necessary path?
- Own your responsibility

**Impact: Be Specific**
- How many people are affected?
- What roles, functions, or locations?
- When will this happen?
- How will people learn their status?

**Support: Detail the Help**
- What support is being provided?
- How does this compare to typical/legal minimum?
- What additional help is being offered?
- What resources are available?

**Transition: The Path Forward**
- How will this proceed?
- What happens next for affected people?
- What happens next for the organization?
- What is the timeline?

**Closing: Human Connection**
- Acknowledge the people as people, not resources
- Express genuine gratitude for their contributions
- Offer personal connection where possible
- End with humanity, not corporate platitudes

### Step 4: Check Against Chesky's Standards

**Human Voice Test:**
- Does this sound like a human being wrote it?
- Would you be comfortable reading this aloud to someone affected?
- Have you removed corporate jargon and euphemisms?

**Vulnerability Test:**
- Are you being honest about the difficulty?
- Are you taking responsibility where appropriate?
- Is there any part that feels defensive or blame-shifting?

**Action Test:**
- Is the support concrete and specific?
- Are you offering more than the minimum?
- Are you actively helping, not just providing resources?

**Respect Test:**
- Are affected people treated as individuals?
- Is their dignity preserved?
- Will they feel cared for even in bad news?

### Step 5: Plan the Delivery

**Timing:**
- When will people learn?
- Is there adequate time to process?
- What happens immediately after?

**Method:**
- How will the message be delivered?
- Who delivers it?
- Is there opportunity for questions?

**Follow-Through:**
- What happens in the hours and days after?
- How do you ensure promises are kept?
- How do you support those who remain?

**Support being provided:** [To be detailed - should exceed minimum]

### Communication Structure

---

**[Opening - Acknowledge]**

I have to share some difficult news with you today, and I want to be direct because you deserve honesty.

We are reducing our workforce by 40 people - 20% of our team. This will be the only round of layoffs. I made the decision to cut deep now rather than put us through multiple rounds, because that would be even more painful and uncertain for everyone.

This is not news I ever wanted to deliver. Many of you have given years to this company, and this decision says nothing about your talent or value. I'm sorry we are here.

---

**[Context - Explain]**

Three months ago, we lost [Major Customer], who represented 30% of our revenue. We explored every alternative: raising emergency funding, cutting non-people costs, accelerating sales, pivoting our product. None of these paths gave us a sustainable way forward at our current size.

I take responsibility for this situation. We should have diversified our customer base more aggressively. We were too dependent on one relationship, and when it ended, it put all of us in this position.

The decision of who is affected was based on which roles are essential for the company's path forward, not on who is more or less valued. Some of our most talented people are leaving because we no longer have the work that matches their skills.

---

**[Impact - Specify]**

40 positions are being eliminated today, affecting people across [Engineering, Sales, Operations, Marketing].

In the next hour, affected employees will receive a meeting invitation from [HR Leader]. If you receive this invitation, you are affected. If you do not receive an invitation in the next hour, your role is continuing.

For those affected, you will have a one-on-one conversation today with your manager and HR to discuss your specific situation, severance, and support.

---

**[Support - Detail]**

We are providing the following support to everyone affected:

**Financial:**
- 12 weeks severance (minimum), plus 1 additional week for every year at the company
- Immediate payout of any unused PTO
- Any bonuses earned through today will be paid

**Healthcare:**
- 6 months of continued health insurance coverage (we will pay your premiums)
- Mental health support through [Provider] for 6 months

**Job Transition:**
- We have partnered with [Outplacement Firm] to provide career coaching, resume help, and interview prep for everyone affected
- We are creating an alumni talent directory - with your permission, we will share your information with our network of investors, partners, and peer companies who are hiring
- I will personally write a reference for anyone who wants one
- [Our investor network] has agreed to prioritize introductions to affected team members

**Practical:**
- You will have until [date] to transition, say goodbye, and collect your things
- We will ship any personal items if you prefer not to come in
- Your company equipment is yours to keep

---

**[Transition - Path Forward]**

For those of you who are leaving: I want you to know that the best thing about this company has been the people. The relationships you built here are real and lasting. Many of you will do better work at your next company than we ever enabled here, and I hope you prove me right.

For those staying: We are now a smaller team with the same mission. I will share more about our path forward in an all-hands meeting tomorrow. Today, please be there for your colleagues.

For everyone: My email is always open. If there is anything I can personally do to help - a reference, an introduction, a conversation - please reach out directly.

---

**[Closing - Connect]**

I want to close by saying thank you - not as a platitude, but as the truth. The 40 people leaving today built things, served customers, and showed up every day to try to make this company succeed. You are not being let go because you failed. You are leaving because I made decisions that put us in this situation, and I am genuinely sorry.

This is the hardest day of my time as CEO. I know it is harder for many of you.

[CEO Name]

- [x] Free of corporate jargon and euphemisms (no "right-sizing" or "resource actions")
- [x] Would be comfortable reading aloud (emotionally honest)

**Vulnerability:**
- [x] Honest about difficulty ("hardest day of my time as CEO")
- [x] Takes appropriate responsibility ("decisions I made put us here")
- [x] Not defensive or blame-shifting (no "market conditions forced us")

- [x] Preserves dignity (transition time, choice about coming in)
- [x] Shows genuine care (equipment to keep, alumni network)

### Risk Review

**What could go wrong:**
- Promises not delivered - Mitigation: Document all commitments, assign owner for each
- Remaining team morale collapse - Mitigation: Quick follow-up all-hands, transparency about path forward
- Affected employees feel blindsided - Mitigation: Clear timeline, immediate 1:1s
- Legal issues - Mitigation: HR and legal review before sending, WARN Act compliance confirmed

**If promises cannot be kept:**
- If funding changes: Communicate immediately, extend support where possible
- If outplacement provider fails: Have backup provider identified; CEO personally assist with references

---

## Constraints

- Legal requirements vary by jurisdiction - ensure compliance with WARN Act, local labor laws
- Promises must be kept - do not offer what you cannot deliver
- This is a framework for humane communication, not a substitute for doing humane things
- The best communication cannot overcome inadequate support
- Delivery matters as much as content - rushed or impersonal delivery undermines the message

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Company cannot afford generous severance | Be honest about constraints; find non-monetary support (references, networking, time) |
| Legal limits what can be said | Work within constraints while maximizing humanity; acknowledge limitations |
| Leader is not the right messenger | Find the most credible voice who can speak authentically |
| Affected employees in different locations/time zones | Plan simultaneous delivery; do not let anyone learn from social media |
| Communication leaks early | Have holding statement ready; accelerate delivery if needed |
| Remaining employees are angry | Acknowledge their feelings; provide space to process; deliver on path forward |

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Brian Chesky** expert persona. It embodies the crisis leadership approach Chesky demonstrated during Airbnb's COVID layoffs, which became a model for humane corporate communication.

Pairs well with:
- **founder-mode-assessment** - for ensuring leader is engaged enough to deliver authentically
- **culture-first-audit** - for ensuring communication aligns with stated values
- **storyboard-experience** - for mapping the affected person's experience of receiving news
